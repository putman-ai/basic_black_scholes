# Black-Scholes
This is a work in progress and these are the very first steps to me digging into options.
It's something that has been on my radar for a long time but I've never gotten around to it.
I'm currently engaged in other research (HRP) but will circle back around to this, dig deeper, add and improve solutions as time allows.

## Warning
Please don't use this! I've noticed some discrepency between the output here and the actual call pricing on Robinhood.
I need to be certain the math and code are correct.
Right now I'm just flagging intent and future development.
